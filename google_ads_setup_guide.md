## 📈 DAILY MONITORING GUIDE

### Check These Metrics Every Morning (9am):

**Performance Overview:**
```
Target Metrics (Daily):
- Impressions: 500-1,500
- Clicks: 10-30 (at R5-15 per click)
- CTR: 3-8% (higher = better ad relevance)
- Calls: 3-8 calls per day
- Cost per Call: R20-50
- Spend: R150 (full budget used)
```

### Red Flags (Fix Immediately):
- ⚠️ CTR below 2% = Ads not relevant, rewrite copy
- ⚠️ CPC above R20 = Bids too high, lower max CPC
- ⚠️ Quality Score below 5 = Keywords/ads not matching landing pages
- ⚠️ 0 calls by noon = Check phone number, call extensions
- ⚠️ Budget spent by 2pm = Increase budget OR lower bids

### Optimization Actions (After 3 Days):

**Pause These Keywords:**
- 0 clicks after 50+ impressions
- CPC above R25 consistently
- 0 calls after 20+ clicks

**Increase Bids (+20%) for:**
- Keywords with 2+ calls
- Quality Score 8+
- Position below 3 (not showing enough)

**Add Negative Keywords:**
```
- "free" (free borehole = not a buyer)
- "diy" (want to do it themselves)
- "how to" (researching, not ready)
- "cost to repair" (just researching)
- "training" (looking for courses)
- "courses" (not a customer)
```

## 📞 EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Not Getting Any Calls" Checklist:
1. Is phone number showing in ads? → Check call extensions
2. Is call tracking working? → Call your own number from ads
3. Are ads actually showing? → Search your keywords manually
4. Is your budget too low? → Check if budget spent by noon
5. Are keywords too broad? → Add more specific phrase match
6. Landing pages broken? → Test all links
7. Office hours only? → Extend to 24/7 for emergencies

### "Spending Too Fast" Fixes:
1. Lower max CPC by 30% across all campaigns
2. Remove broad match keywords, use phrase/exact only
3. Add more negative keywords
4. Reduce geographic radius from 25km to 15km
5. Pause lowest-performing ad groups

### "Not Showing in Search" Fixes:
1. Increase bids by 20-30%
2. Improve quality score (rewrite ads to match keywords better)
3. Check if location targeting is correct
4. Ensure daily budget isn't exhausted
5. Make sure campaigns are ACTIVE not paused

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM CALLS

### Make Your Phone Ring More:
1. **Use Call-Only Ads:** Create mobile-only ads that ONLY show phone number (no website click option)
2. **Call Tracking:** Consider using a call tracking service like CallRail to record calls and track quality
3. **Response Time:** Answer EVERY call within 30 seconds - missed calls = wasted ad spend
4. **Voicemail:** Professional voicemail message: "You've reached Borehole Pros emergency service. Leave your number and we'll call back within 15 minutes."
5. **WhatsApp:** Add WhatsApp extension to ads (many SA customers prefer WhatsApp)

### Answer These Questions When Calls Come:
- "How soon can you come?" → "Within 2-4 hours for emergencies"
- "How much will it cost?" → "We provide free quotes on-site, but typical [service] costs R[range]"
- "Are you available now?" → "Yes! We're available 24/7. Where are you located?"
- "Do you service [area]?" → "Yes, we cover all of [city] including [their area]"
